First create a flowchart that will perform the following behavior. Then implement the flowchart with RAT MCU assembly language. Make sure your code is in proper form including comments. Use the RAT MCU Simulator to ensure you program performs as desired.
Create an array in the data segment that contains the first 14 values of Fibonacci sequence (starting with 0 and ending with 233). Write a program that progresses through the array and calculates the difference between values that are 3 spots away from each other. For example, the first value (0) and the 4th value (2) is a difference of 2. The next calculation would be between the 2nd (1) and 5th (3) values. When no item exists 3 spots away, no difference can be calculated. Each difference should be output to port_id 0x42.
Create an array of 10 values. Read 10 values from port_id 0x9A saving them in the array. After the 10th value has been saved, the array should be sorted from least to greatest. The sorted array should be output to port_id 0x42 in order least to greatest.
